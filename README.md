# Hyde

### For when you want a static website, not a Ph. D in Jekyll

A static website generator in Go, like Jekyll, without the nonsensical complications. Point it at an input directory and an output directory and it will make a website. 

No Ruby, No Gems, No Coffeescript. Just Go.

# Basic Idea

You create a series of files with markdown in them, the program recursively compiles them to HTML in the target directory in the same structure.
